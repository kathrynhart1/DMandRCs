Neptune, the most distant planet in our Solar System, orbits more than five times slower than Earth does, at about 5 km/s.

    "When you look at this galaxy, you see its luminous matter (often a luminous “disk”), like stars and gas. Try to imagine the speed at which the stars in these galaxies are rotating around the massive galactic center. Are the inner stars toward the more massive center moving faster than the outer ones? \n",
    "\n",
    "The luminous matter decreases with distance from the center, meaning most of the galaxy's matter is enclosed within a given star's orbit and exerts gravity as a central dominant mass (like the Sun). Therefore you would naturally expect stars at large distances to orbit slower than the inner stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to astronomers’ surprise, stars orbiting far from their galactic center are moving way faster than expected. Though luminous matter decreases significantly as you look further out (meaning mass enclosed in far-out stars’ orbits is roughly constant with increasing distance), stars beyond the luminous disk rotate at the same or even higher speeds than stars closer to the galactic center do. This would be analogous to Uranus orbiting the Sun just as fast as Mercury. These stars <i>should</i> be following the same rotation speed pattern that the planets in the Solar System do, but they don’t. This suggests that the mass enclosed must be increasing along with distance, implying that there is some “invisible” matter that extends beyond the luminous disk.\n",

    "Vera Rubin, born in 1928, took the lead on investigating this discrepancy between the predicted and observed orbital velocities of luminous matter in spiral galaxies. She studied what we call flat rotation curves (below) to compare an object's rotation speed with its distance from its respective galactic center.  \n",

    "Rubin hypothesized that there must be a large amount of unseen mass keeping matter at large distances from the center in orbit, providing the first evidence that there is more matter in spiral galaxies than meets the eye. Matter that does not reflect, emit, absorb, or interact at all with light. Her studies indicated the existence of dark matter.\n",

    "Rubin's work was especially impactful because of the stunning visuals (in her papers) of rotation data she and her colleagues had measured. She presented this research at various scientific conferences in a clear, direct manner that made her results undeniable. Additionally, this pivotal discovery made Rubin a pioneer for women in astronomy. With numerous studies of galactic rotation, Rubin opened up an entirely new field of study that would puzzle astronomers for decades to come.\n",
